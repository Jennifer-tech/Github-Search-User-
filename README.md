## GITHUB USER SEARCH

This project consumes GitHub REST API and uses Redux and Redux toolkits for its global state management.
 
The user of the project inputs any GitHub username of his/her choice, on the click of the search button, the user input is displayed with the user's avatar and on clicking on the user card, you will be directed to the user details page, where the userâ€™s location, Followers and repositories, etc. are displayed. 

This could help my app users easily locate a user and have a quick overview of the searched user which GitHub does not offer at a glance.

### TECHNOLOGIES USED

* [React](https://reactjs.org/)
